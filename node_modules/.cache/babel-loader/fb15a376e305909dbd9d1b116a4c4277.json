Without Earth, we cannot even imagine living. Have you ever thought how we would walk if there is no Earth, there will be no water to drink, there will not be animals living here, and of course, no cultivation, so no food to eat. This means to say that the life of humans, as well as other living beings, cannot be imagined without Earth. Life is possible on the planet Earth and its related resources. Can you imagine a life on the Earth if resources are not available here. And, the answer comes not at all. The resources like air, sunlight, water, creatures, minerals, and vegetation are integral parts of the Earth. But with the increasing level of pollution, these resources are getting affected and either humans are destroying or depleting recklessly. If we have not taken a calculative step to save the Earth, it is going to be difficult to establish a sustainable future on the earth. Let\\u2019s understand why is it so crucial to save the Earth from these things: WhyiIs Saving The Earth Necessary? In order to save the earth, we must understand that resources that are provided by earth are limited. However, the majority of us are unaware of this fact and we are not judiciously utilizing the resources. In order to safeguard the existence of humans, we need to protect the earth and take care of it. All living beings are dependent on the earth for their survival and so we should use the gist of nature in a thoughtful way. The increase in pollution and damage caused by humans are affecting the earth so rapidly that it is threatening our survival. Saving earth is not merely the need of the hour but much more. The extent of degradation caused by humans is becoming irreparable. This is one of the reasons why all the resources are getting highly polluted. The change in climate is also one of the examples that are caused due to severe pollution. Moreover, animals, birds are getting extinct and the worlds around us are slowly approaching the end. Nothing could be scarier than this. Therefore, saving the earth is the primary need and we should make conscious decisions to make the earth a better and sustainable place to live in. It is and has been our responsibility to protect the planet that we live in but rather we become selfish and do such things that create more pollution in our environment. As the most evolved species of the environment, we should understand that our planet is the only planet that supports life. So when the earth will be in peril, we will not have the option to move to another planet for our safety. Hence, it is important to make the most use of what we have right now in a sustainable manner. Our approach will not only save the earth but our lives as well. Moreover, our future generation will be bestowed with a healthy environment to live in. Ten Simple Things to Save the Earth Live by the mantra- Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Keep our surroundings clean Plant more trees Conserve water and water bodies Educate people about the significance of conserving nature Shop wisely Cycle more and drive fewer cars on the road Use LED lights Don\\u2019t discharge industrial effluents in the river or other water bodies Choose sustainability in every step of life Therefore, by making small changes in our lifestyle we can make a huge difference. By restoring ecological balance, we can save the earth from getting dreadfully polluted and uninhabitable.\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 18,\n              columnNumber: 21\n            }, this)]\n          }, void 0, true, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 16,\n            columnNumber: 19\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 8,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 7,\n        columnNumber: 15\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 6,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this);\n  }\n\n}","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:/Users/Carl/Documents/MyPortfolio/React/Marasigan-Blog/src/Components/About.js"],"names":["React","Component","About","render"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC,C,CACA;;;AACA,eAAe,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBD,SAApB,CAA8B;AACzCE,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACL,wBACI;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA,6BACE;AAAK,QAAA,KAAK,EAAC,WAAX;AAAA,+BACE;AAAK,UAAA,KAAK,EAAC,6BAAX;AAAA,kCACE;AAAK,YAAA,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;AAAA,mCACE;AACE,cAAA,KAAK,EAAC,gCADR;AAEE,cAAA,GAAG,EAAC,2XAFN;AAGE,cAAA,GAAG,EAAC;AAHN;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADF,eAQE;AAAK,YAAA,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;AAAA,oCACC;AAAI,cAAA,KAAK,EAAC,mBAAV;AAAA,qCAA8B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAA9B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBADD,eAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBAFF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBARF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADJ;AA8DC;;AAhEoC","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\n//About Page\r\nexport default class About extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div className=\"about\">\r\n              <div class=\"container\">\r\n                <div class=\"row align-items-center my-5\">\r\n                  <div class=\"col-lg-7\">\r\n                    <img\r\n                      class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-4 mb-lg-0\"\r\n                      src=\"https://scontent.fmnl13-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/54279665_426109924804450_6039882959266250752_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_eui2=AeEUWUIeD3ZVrbmFZBzji67hvU2J915BVqy9TYn3XkFWrKWucU4qjC4V8C2UnHIC2FvvojSmitdwda03PT5kpT3h&_nc_ohc=6UKf_Bq0yusAX8lWANH&tn=9tnjZO0eUwHOIs9m&_nc_ht=scontent.fmnl13-1.fna&oh=00_AT_fSzfDoNFDZJS8sGjN0hQUxEGctjE9B64M9Y7dUkzpMg&oe=628E8700\"\r\n                      alt=\"\"\r\n                    />\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"col-lg-5\">\r\n                   <h1 class=\"font-weight-light\"><str>Earth Blog</str></h1>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Each living being on Earth knows the importance of Earth in our lives.
