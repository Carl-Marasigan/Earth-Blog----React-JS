                     Earth is the only planet which can
                     sustain life on it. We do not have a 
                     planet B which we can move onto. 
                     This makes it all the more serious to save 
                     the earth and save our lives. If we do not take
                      strict actions now, we will lose the chance of seeing
                       our future generations flourish forever. 
                       Everyone must come together for the same causes, 
                       as we are inhabitants of this planet firstly and
                        then anything else.
